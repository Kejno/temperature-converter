`cToF` for converting Celcius to Fahrenheit
`fToC` for converting Fahrenheit to Celcius

For example:
```js
 cToF(84) // 183.20
 cToF(47) // 8.33
```

Please note, that all calculations should be done with two decimal places.

Write your code in `src/index.js.
*All test cases are designed as “error-free”, so don't worry about handling any errors.*

## Prepare and test
